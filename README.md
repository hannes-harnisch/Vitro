# Vitro
This project is an ongoing exercise/experiment in low-level GPU programming and designing a scalable cross-platform C++ architecture for a rendering engine. Vitro is intended to grow into a multiplatform 2D/3D scene viewer/editor and rendering engine. It relies heavily on C++20 features, especially modules. Currently, a build of the newest Premake branch is required in order to generate project files.

The graphics API currently used primarily for development is Direct3D 12. A Vulkan backend is being added gradually. In terms of operating systems, only Windows is currently supported, with a Linux backend planned.
